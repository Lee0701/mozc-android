"""A script to embed the given (relative) path name to C/C++ characters array.

Example:
  ./embed_pathname.py --path_to_be_embedded=d:\data\mozc
      --constant_name=kMozcDataDir --output=mozc_data_dir.h
  Then you will get 'mozc_data_dir.h' which consists of the following line.
      const char kMozcDataDir[] = "d:\\data\\mozc";
